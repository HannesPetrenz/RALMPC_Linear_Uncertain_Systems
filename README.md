# RALMPC_Linear_Uncertain_Systems
This repository contains the MATLAB implementation for the Robust Adaptive Learning Model Predictive Control (RALMPC) framework proposed in the paper Robust MPC for uncertain linear systems. The method is designed for linear systems with parametric uncertainties and additive disturbances performing iterative tasks.
